Welcome this challenging playground for those how love coding. Inspired by [programming-challenges.com](http://programming-challenges.com), [SwiftAlgorithmsClassroom](https://github.com/gmertk/SwiftAlgorithmsClassroom) and the [Fellowswift](http://fellowswift.com) community.

Periodically a programming challenge will be published in this repo as a pending issue. You should fork this repository and send a pull request as your solution to the issue. We will do peer-review by commenting others' solutions. We will learn and teach all together.

Please remember that you should not make any assumption unless it is indicated in the challenge. Your solution should deal with negative numbers, decimals, or wrong inputs unless it is indicated like that in the problem.

And please remember that this is a respectful team. Please review and read the comments of the pull requests of your peers with respect.

### Contributing

Do you have a great idea that you would like to share with us?      
Do you have a nice problem that you would like to propose for the challenge?
Anything... ?

Please contact us, we are really looking forward you comments.
